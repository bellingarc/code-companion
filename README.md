# Tech Stack

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Create Electron App](https://www.electronforge.io/) 

## Available Scripts    

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`
Uses [Concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently) to run electron ONLY after React has finished loading
Runs the app in the development mode.
No need to open localhost or a browser window, Electron will handle that for you. 


The page will not reload if you make edits, however a Ctrl+R reset will update most changes.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run make`

Builds the app for production to the `out` folder.\
It currently correctly bundles React and Electron in production mode for win-32 archx64 and optimizes the build for the best performance.
MacOS, linux, and Solaris builds coming soon.
